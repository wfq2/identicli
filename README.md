This repository uses:
Poetry for dependency management: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/
python 3.9.  
I recommend using pycharm to code here.  
for pre-commit do:
```
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
now pre commit will run before you can push to github to keep our code nice and clean
```
